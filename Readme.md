# Lattice Boltzmann method simulation
When we want to see the simulation follow the steps:
+ we should first execute the RB2.py
+ it will output plain text files of array of graphs
+ When RB2.py is stopped, we then execute the project.py
+ it will translate the text files to make 80200 boxes in vpython

# Though that...
+ The most normal way to see the simulation is execute the RB.py that generate imgs
